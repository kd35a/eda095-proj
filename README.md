# ChatServer

This is the project-part of the course [EDA095 - Network Programming](http://cs.lth.se/eda095) at [LTH](http://www.lth.se/).

## Main goal

The main goal of our project is to implement a chat-server and a client that can connect to this server. It
will consist of rooms where you can chat with multiple people, and private messages that are just sent to one
user.
